<h1>Welcome to our ngCheckers' GitHub repo!</h1>
<h2>How Branches will work:</h2>

- There is a **main** branch which holds the **working bug-free code**
- Everyone will have their **own** branch for development
- We should consider having a **dev** branch that is a clone of master.
  - That way we can verify the changes work in the master version.

For info on what branches are and how they work, see [GitHub Docs - Branches](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches)
